== DESCRIPTION

Rails Mechanical Turk app for the approval/disapproval of images.


== TODO

1) Create rake task that generates turk tasks for unprocessed images

   a) External form should point to Images#show
   b) mark all as processed


2) def self.hit_complete(turkee_task)
     #do something
   end

   Be sure to approve or disapprove, depending on whether the three assigments
   are in agreement on whether nudity exists or not.

   Look to ActionTraction for an implementation of this.
